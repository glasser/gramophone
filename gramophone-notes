So far:

- Buy Arduino Uno

- (and power supply... MakerShed kit comes with 9V battery, eg, which needed to
  be soldered together)

- And AdaFruit WaveShield v1.1

- Solder WaveShield. Needed a few jumpers at the end. Would have appreciated
  some female header: 8 + 8 + 6 + 6; soldered instead.

- Soldered leads to 5v, ground, digital input 6.  Note: Don't use digital pin 0
  or 1: they're for serial communication! Or 13: it's got an LED!

- Reed switch yay.

- Hall effect sensor is more sturdy than reed switch. It's also more complex:
  needs a magnet in the opposite direction to turn it off.  When looking at the
  label, pins are from left to right POWER, GROUND, OUT.  Note that the HES
  operates by pulling down, so we need a pull-up resistor on its output, not a
  pull-down like we'd been doing with the reed switch.  Attached RED = POWER,
  BLACK = GROUND, YELLOW = OUT.


compress = 1
channels = 1
sampleRate = 00005622 = 22050
bytepersecond = 00005622 = 22050
blockalign = 1
bitspersample = 8


- need to set my sketchbook location to be the main 'gramophone' folder,
  otherwise it can't find libraries
